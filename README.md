# Spotify Track Analysis 2023
 An investigation into tracks from 2000-2022 that have been included on the Spotify Top Hits playlist.

 From this analysis, I was able to obtain a better understanding of what quantifiable track attributes most popular tracks included in these playlists have in common. As a musician, this was extremely interesting for me to dig into!

 To summarize my findings, I've created a Tableau Dashboard, here: https://public.tableau.com/views/SpotifyTopTrackAnalysis2000-2023/TopTrackTrends?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

 The dataset utilized in this analysis was found via Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephinelsy/spotify-top-hit-playlist-2010-2022
